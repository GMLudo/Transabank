Transabank
==========

Transabank converts a crappy export from your bank (CSV, HTML, PDF) to a comprehensive format (OFX, QIF, CSV) for your accounting software (KMyMoney, GnuCash...).

-------
Warning
-------

It works but deutschebank2ofx package must be refactored.
For now, only CSV from Deutsche Bank Belgium to QIF is supported.

--------------------------
Why use QIF instead of OFX
--------------------------

OFX is a better format than QIF, more complete and standardised.
Unfortunately, OFX doesn't support category, I need that for my personnal accounting.
